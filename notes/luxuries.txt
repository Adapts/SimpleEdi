Luxuries are resources that impart morale.

Each citizen class demands a certain level of a selection of resources.  The
"normal" level of demand is set in the resource's data; some items (like cigars)
are consumed quickly and thus a large quantity are demanded each turn, while
others (like furniture) are consumed slowly and only a small quantity are
demanded each turn.

If the demand is met, then that citizen class gets a morale boost (also set in
the resource's data).  If we have some resources, but not enough to meet the
demand, then we get a small portion of the morale; the equation is:
(Resource.morale * 0.5 * resources_provided) / Resource.demand
Thus, if we provide 50% of the demanded level, we get 25% of the morale.
If we provide more than is demanded, there is no extra bonus.
