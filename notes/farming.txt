A building's field_output is defined as:
(S * ((F * T) / 100)) / 5

Where:
S = our race's farming skill
F = the amount of RES_FARMING the building produces
T = the farmability of the terrain

Example:  Humans (skill 4) using standard farm (RES_FARMING 10) on rocky
          (farmability 65)
(4 * ((10 * 65) / 100)) / 5
(4 * (650 / 100)) / 5
(4 * 6) / 5
24 / 5
4

The amount of each crop is multiplied by our field_output.  In the scenario
above, each field produces 4 instances of the given crop!
