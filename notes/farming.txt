A building's field_output is defined as (S * F * T)

Where:
S = our race's farming skill
F = the amount of RES_FARMING the building produces
T = the farmability of the terrain

Example:  Humans (skill 4) using standard farm (RES_FARMING 10) on rocky
          (farmability 65)
(4 * 10 * 65)
2600

The amount of food and resources each crop provides is multiplied by our
field_output, then divided by 500 (as late as possible).  It's divided by 500
because terrain farmability is meant to be a percentage, from 0 to 100, so that
requires dividing by 100; also, farming skill is percentage-like, from 0 to 5,
so that requires dividing by 5.
In the scenario above, each field produces 5.2 times the crop's food output.  If
we are farming, for example, cabbage, its food value of 120 becomes 624.  This
value is meant to be 100 times the actual food output, so we divide by 100 again
to get a final value of 6.24 per field.
This final division by 100 is done after ALL crops are totaled.  So if we have
15 fields of cabbage, our food output is (624 * 15) / 100, for a grand total of
93 food (we round this final division down).
