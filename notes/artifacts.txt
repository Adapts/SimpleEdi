Artifacts can be made or found.
Making an artifact either happens randomly (very rarely) or by intentionally
telling your blacksmith to work on an artifact.
  Should this require:
    -A special building?
    -Unlocking it?
    -Special resources?
      Maybe the strength of the artifact is partially dependent on the resources
      you spend on it.

A constructed artifact has a few random abilities - all positive.

Artifacts found in the wild have a few random abilities, which may be positive
OR negative.  They are generally found in special locations (ancient temples,
etc.) but may rarely be found simply by exploring the wilderness.

A few very rare "ancient artifacts" are found in the wild.  These have unique
abilities, and are only obtained via some very difficult task.
  Raiding a large, dangerous dungeon
  Killing a dragon
  etc.
