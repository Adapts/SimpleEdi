Each god appreciates worship.  Their opinion generally increases as the number
of worshippers goes up.  Active worshippers (i.e. those with access to a temple
devoted to this god) are worth much more than passive ones.
Gods also appreciate or dislike certain actions, listed below.  Some gods do not
have one or either.
Finally, gods may issue edicts or quests.  Completing one will provide a large
one-time boost.
If a god's opinion is less than zero, it will very slowly trend towards zero.
The god will have a chance to perform a Wrath, which will move their opinion
towards zero.
If a god's opinion is greater than zero, they may have passive bonuses, as well
as several boons which are activated either at random, or by invoking their
power (this requires a grand temple?  High priest?)
Otherwise, if a god's opinion is less than or greater than the natual level
(i.e. that determined by the number of worshippers) it will slowly trend towards
the natural level.

GOD DETAILS:
Lumos - God of light, purity, cleansing
  Likes:
    When corruption is removed
    When worshippers of Fallos are fought
  Dislikes:
    Use of addictive substances
  Quests:
    Cleanse Evil - A nearby colony of unclean monsters is revealed to you.  It
      must be destroyed within a time limit.
    Cleanse Corruption - A nearby area of corruption is revealed to you.  It
      must be removed by sending a priest there.
  Passive:
    Weather tends to be angled towards sunny.
    When fighting evil/unclean monsters, or worshippers of Fallos, the enemy
      fights at -25% strength.
  Boons:
    Nourishing Sunlight - Crops produce much more than usual.
    Block Storm - You get a storm counter.  Whenever a storm would appear, if
      you have any storm counters, one is expended and the storm is prevented.
    Cleansing - Disease and addiction is removed from your town.
  Wrath:
    Heat wave - Temperature increases significantly, reducing worker output and
      potentially killing crops.
    Darkness - The light is blocked out for several weeks, negating crop output.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Lumos is a good option for those reliant on crops, or those suffering from
      frequent disease or widespread drug use.  An army must be kept, to obey
      Lumos's demands for cleansing.

Aeros - God of wind, the weather
  Likes:
    When you explore the world.  The exposed world map is added as a base boost
      to piety.
  Dislikes:
    When no units are in the field.
  Quests:
  Passive:
    Your troops get a minor movement speed boost.  If your troops can fly, this
      boost is instead major.
  Boons:
    Block Storm - You get a storm counter.  Whenever a storm would appear, if
      you have any storm counters, one is expended and the storm is prevented.
    Send Storm - A storm is sent to a location of your choice.  Its power scales
      with Aeros's favor.
  Wrath:
    Storm - A storm is sent in.  Its power scales with how angry Aeros is.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Aeros is an easy god to play, and of particular interest for flying races
      who want to increase their movement advantage.  Aeros also makes living in
      stormy areas safer.  NEEDS MORE!

Earth Mother - God of growth and decay
  Likes:
    Allowing trees to grow
  Dislikes:
    Destruction of trees
  Quests:
    Plant forest - You are asked to plant a forest in a designated area within a
      time limit.
  Passive:
    Taming of Beasts - Monsters attack less and are easier to hunt.
    Crop boost - Farms produce greater than usual output.
  Boons:
    Forest growth - Forest grows around your city, unintrusively.
    Gift of the trees - You are given a supply of wood.
  Wrath:
    Reclaim - Forest grows in your city, possibly destroying buildings.
    Forest Beasts - Wildlife attacks your city.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Earth Mother encourages an alternate approach to wood collection, and is a
      default for Elves and Dendroids, who don't wish to destroy trees anyway.
      She makes living in wooded areas very advantageous, and basic food
      collection much easier.

Nephyrlallo - God of the ocean, rivers, lakes and swamps
  Likes:
    Exploration of the sea
    Reliance on the sea/river/swamp (buildings close to it)
  Dislikes:
    Overfishing (e.g. collecting more than (favor + 50) fish per week)
  Quests:
    Water Expansion - The player must build a channel of considerable size,
      extending the sea/river/swamp further inland.
  Passive:
    Calm Waters - Seastorms and floods are less common.
    Swift Journey - The speed of your boats (or swimming units) is faster.
    Plentiful Waters - Your fishing tends to be luckier.
  Boons:
    Bounty of the Sea - A great harvest (beached whale, kelp tide, fish
      migration) is delivered
    Protection of the Sea - Sea storms are created around your city, which your
      ships/units are protected from.  Only occurs on prayer or if units are
      approaching.  For rivers, this may be replaced by a drought, preventing
      ships/units from traveling via river.  For the swamp, this may be replaced
      by horrible disease.
  Wrath:
    Wrath of the (Sea/River/Swamp) - A storm hits you;
      -Sea: Hurricane, typhoon, etc.
      -River: Flood, drought
      -Swamp: Flood, drought, disease
    Anger of the (Sea/River/Swamp) - A mighty beast attacks;
      -Sea: Kraken, Sea Serpent
      -River: Great Fish, plague of eels/frogs
      -Swamp: Swamp Beast
  Playstyle Notes:
    Nephyrlallo is a "default" for those who depend on a source of water,
      particularly the ocean.  River/Swamp cities may turn to Nephrylallo to
      support their food production without many requirements.  Seaside cities
      have more to gain from Nephyrlallo, as she encourages a naval playstyle
      significantly stronger.

Vertumnus - God of the seasons and changes
  Likes:
    When seasonal festivals are held
  Dislikes:
  Quests:
    Seasonal;
      Spring - You are called upon to plant several forests.
      Summer - You are called upon to build homes and explore.
      Autumn - You are called upon to attack enemies.
      Winter - You are called upon to retreat units home.
  Passive:
    Seasonal bonuses;
      Spring - Farms are cheaper to build
      Summer - Morale is heightened
      Autumn - Farms produce additional food
      Winter - Food consumption is reduced
  Boons:
    Seasonal boons;
      Spring - Reproduction is increased dramatically
      Summer - Storm counter (lasts until Autumn)
      Autmun - Farms produce MUCH more food
      Winter - Storm counter (lasts until spring)
  Wrath:
    Seasonal wrath;
      Spring - Crop failure; farms are destroyed.
      Summer - Drought
      Autumn - Crop failure; farms produce no food
      Winter - Storm
  Playstyle Notes:
    Vertumnus is a good god for the early game, as he promotes rapid growth and
      makes food management much easier.  Once a city has these under control,
      or if a city gets a large portion of its food from imports, Vertumnus is
      less useful.  Also, his control over the rhythm of your play (with the
      regularly-delivered quests) can be frustrating.  Fortunately, Vertumnus's
      wrath is not so bad (IF farms aren't critical for you).

Forge Father - God of heat, industry, transformation
  Likes:
    Operating forges - a small bonus, comparable to worshippers
  Dislikes:
    Unemployment - All unemployed citizens are treated as -2 worshippers.
  Quests:
    Construct Idol - A special building is unlocked - an idol, buildable at huge
      cost.  The idol is forged from a processed material (brick, steel, etc).
  Passive:
    The output of your forges is increased.
  Boons:
  Wrath:

Fiera - God of the hunt (and fishing)
  Likes:
    When you have a successful hunt.
  Dislikes:
    Killing a holy beast (unicorn, etc)
  Quests:
    Legendary Hunt - Fiera will reveal the domain of a legendary beast.  You
      have a limited time to kill or capture the beast; killing it proides a
      small piety boost, capturing it very large.  If captured, the beast is
      tamed.
  Passive:
    Huntsman's Glory - You receive a basic boost to luck in all hunts, scaling
      with Fiera's favor.
  Boons:
    
  Wrath:

Eneri - God of artistic pursuits

  Dislikes:
  Quests:
  Passive:
  Boons:

Bacchos - God of hedonism and alcohol

  Boons:
  Wrath:

Farlange - God of roads, travel, trade
  Likes:
    When roads are built.
    When trade is conducted, preferably with those far away
    When heroes are sent to distant cities.
  Dislikes:
    When you destroy roads
    When you have no units afield
  Quests:
    Holy Road - You are called upon to build a road to a randomly-selected
      location. When completed, a holy site is created at that location and you
      receive a piety gain proportional to the length of the road.
    Pilgrimage - You are called upon to send a number of worshippers to a holy
      site of Farlange, either one constructed via Holy Road or another city
      which has Farlange as its patron.  Upon their arrival, you receive piety
      proportional to the distance and the number of pilgrims.
    Eternal Pilgrimage - You are called upon to send a number of worshippers on
      an unending pilgrimage of travel.  They will travel at Farlange's
      discretion, and will essentially be lost to you--they will never return
      home.  As long as they live, they will be counted as 10 times the number
      of worshippers they are,  will receive double Traveler's Protection (see
      below under Passive), and will have diplomacy boosts, spreading the word
      of Farlange and your city.  They will also send maps of their travels
      home.
  Passive:
    Traveler's Protection - Your units afield cannot be ambushed (by monsters or
      by armies), and are protected from damage when fleeing (up to a limit?).
      When traveling via road, your units travel at 1.5x the normal speed.
      Hostile encounters are reduced.
    Road Building - You build roads twice as fast (and at lowered resource
      costs?).
    Holy Trade - The overhead costs of trading are reduced.  Unlike the trade
      skill, this only applies to your costs, not those of your trade partner.
  Boons:
    Laying the Path - Farlange will occasionally gift you with several tiles
      of road, generally in the direction of a city or feature which is
      currently not directly connected to you by road.  If this boon is
      requested, you can request 
    Showing the Way - Farlange will reveal to you the location of a city or
      feature.  If performed by request, you may name the feature (NOTE: This
      will probably require a special interface.  In particular, if we know that
      we are at war with the Orcs of Thurgal, then the interface should list
      Thurgal as an option, probably with a note saying "AT WAR").
  Wrath:
    Wanderlust - Several of your citizens will leave your city in multiple
      groups.  Each group has a timer for when they will return home; however,
      they may resettle in another city before that timer is reached, and never
      return.
    Denying the Way - You temporarily lose any movement bonuses from roads.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Farlange offers improved mobility and safety for players who use roads
      extensively.  He also makes exploring and expanding much easier.
      Farlange makes it harder to rely on domestic production, since at any
      moment you may be called upon to send citizens afield (and Far generally
      appreciates having them afield), but fortunately also makes it easier to
      rely on imported goods, making him a good option for cities which do not
      have impressive domestic output anyway.

Beogh - God of warfare and bloodshed (Honorable warfare for its own sake)
  Likes:
    When you declare war before attacking
      -Note: Maybe Beogh should just be the god of warfare, not *honorable*
       warfare.  If so, remove the "before attacking" part.
    Your military victories (i.e. battles)
    When an enemy capitulates
  Dislikes:
    When you declare peace (this penalty must be higher than the bonus for
      declaring war to avoid farming)
    Dishonorable warfare (e.g. assassination, sappers, spies)
    Retreating from any battle
  Quests:
    Holy War - Beogh demands that you declare war on a random neighbor.  This is
      weighted by friendliness and power; Beogh will only very rarely demand
      that you declare war on someone much more powerful, or a close ally.  If
      war is not declared, piety is lost; otherwise, piety gains (see Likes) are
      doubled for this war, as are passive bonuses.
  Passive:
    Combat Might - The combat stats of all units are increased by an amount
      which scales with favor.  Melee is affected more than ranged.
    Noble Combat - War weariness is reduced by an amount which scales with favor
      and is eventually removed altogether.
  Boons:
  Wrath:
    Weak Target - All others gain a morale boost for attacking you while this is
      active.  Beogh followers immediately gain a Holy War quest with you as the
      target.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Beogh is an easy god to play--so long as you don't mind near-constant
      warfare.  With no activated abilities and across-the-board bonuses, this
      is a good choice for players new to the game who want a war-centric run.

Awahri - God of conquest and empire (Warfare to expand empire & kill heretics)
  Likes:
    When you conquer cities.
    When you kill non-believers.
    When you convert cities to the faith.
  Dislikes:
    When you attack fellow Awahri followers.
    When your High Priest dies.
  Quests:
    Holy City - Awahri demands that you capture a target city.
    Heretic - Awahri demands that a Hero of another faith be captured or killed.
  Passive:
    Priests of Awahri can learn combat spells in the temple.
      -Expand upon this...
    War weariness is reduced for wars which Awahri demands.
  Boons:
    Holy Wrath - Awahri will, at his discretion only, unleash his furor on an
      enemy army, instantly killing several soldiers.  This is weighted towards
      occuring when relevant to any Likes or active Quests.
    High Priest - Any priest may be instantly converted to a Hero, the High
      Priest of Awahri.  This occurs immediately after reaching a certain piety
      level.  There can only be one High Priest; if it dies, then another will
      replace it after a while.  The High Priest grants significant boosts to
      the combat skills of all units in its army, and increases the chance of
      Holy Wrath.
      The High Priest may also be used 
  Wrath:
    Holy War - All followers of Awahri are called upon to attack you.
    Holy Wrath - Awahri's wrath is unleashed upon you, as above.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Awahri is, like Beogh, good if you plan to be at war a lot of the time, but
      is much more difficult to handle.  With no basic boosts to combat, and war
      weariness reduction only part of the time, the normal challenges of combat
      are still there.  The High Priest-oriented aspect of Awahri encourages a
      single large army, as opposed to more complex maneuvering; if a single
      city is to be attacked, Awahri is a great choice.

Trinos - God of harmony and peace (Peace for its own sake)
  Likes:
    When you are at peace with neighbors (this is considered a part of "base"
      piety, like # of followers).
  Dislikes:
    When you are at war with neighbors (this is considered a part of "base"
      piety, like # of followers, and is much higher than the Like).
  Quests:
    Fellowship - Trinos reveals an undiscovered neighbor, and asks that you
      enter into peaceful relations with them.
  Passive:
    All other nations experience increased war weariness when at war with you.
      This scales with piety.
    All other nations experience a morale boost for agreeing to treaties you
      propose, whether they are political, trade, etc.
  Boons:
    Turn Back - An army near your city will immediately start marching away. The
      piety cost of requesting this scales with the size of the army.  This
      effect will eventually wear off; how long this takes depends on the
      intelligence (?) of the army.
  Wrath:
    Weakness in Battle - Your military units suffer severe combat penalties.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Trinos is a good god for beginners who aren't interested in warfare, just
      city-building.  Enemies will tend to avoid war with the player, and can be
      more easily persuaded to agree to treaties.  The Turn Back ability also
      provides a panic button (albeit a temporary one), which gives beginners a
      second chance to find a way to handle that oncoming army.

Sekhmet - God of pestilence and ruin (Warfare which maximizes destruction)
  Likes:
    When you destroy buildings (which you didn't build).
    When you burn forests.
    When you kill military units or citizens.
  Dislikes:
    When you capture or release military units or citizens without killing them.
  Quests:
    Path of Destruction - Sekhmet will choose, more or less at random, a target
      for destruction.  It may be a city, a forest, fields, etc.
  Passive:
    Berserk Fury - Military units may enter a fury, indiscriminately killing
      whichever enemy is closest, and destroying anything they can.  While this
      is active, their combat prowess is tripled (melee only).
  Boons:
    Plague - Sekhmet unleashes a plague upon your enemies (or even friends).
      This is frequently done at random, but may be requested via sacrifice.
      -Plague of locusts - Destroy farms.
      -Plague of boils - Spread disease among citizens.
      -Plague of meteor - Much rarer than the others.
  Wrath:
    Plages unleashed upon you as above.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Sekhmet suits a player who's interested in warfare, but not interested in
      managing their conquests.  Situationally, Sekhmet suits a relatively weak
      state who's under the threat of one or more powerful enemies.  Sekhmet's
      plagues can stand in for a strong army, and delay opponents from attack.

Erimar - God of deceit, spies
  Likes:
    When espionage is carried out.
    When you break treaties or betray friends (preferably via espionage)
  Dislikes:
    When you declare war before attacking.
    When your secrets are leaked.
  Quests:
    Grand Jester - Erimar assigns you a more or less frivolous espionage mission
      such as stealing a king's clothing or creating a diplomatic incident.
      -These may have a postive effect of reducing the target's citizens'
       loyalty.
      -The target is assigned completely randomly, and may be a friend or enemy.
  Passive:
    Your espionage missions have higher success rates.
  Boons:
  Wrath:

Fallos - God of the dark arts and demons
  Likes:
    Sacrifice - The boost from this is adjusted by class (slaves are worth the
      least, nobles the most) and race (your own race is preferred, others are
      accepted).  Sacrificing a hero is very highly valued.
  Dislikes:
  Quests:
    Corrupt - Fallos demands that you bring chaos to a given area, most likely
      one settled by a neighbor.  A priest can start the corruption in that
      area; this will spawn volcanoes, creating demon spawn areas, and downgrade
      terrain (forest -> fertile, fertile -> barren, barren -> corrupt)
  Passive:
    Demon Summoning - Priests of Fallos can summon demons to aid in combat.
    Foul Harvest - Worshippers of Fallos can build a Demonic Garden, a farm
      which may be planted on corrupt terrain.
  Boons:
    Blood Ritual - This boon only appears via prayer, and must be accompanied by
      a sacrifice.  The value of the sacrifice is treated as in Likes above.
      An enemy army or village within the range of the sacrifice is stricken by
      sudden death which scales with the value of the sacrifice.
    Demonic Hero - A demon is summoned and is treated as a hero with a selected
      type.  If this happens via prayer, you may choose the type of hero;
      otherwise, it is randomly chosen (according to need?):
      -Assassin: A powerful shapeshifting, teleporting demonic assassin which
       disappears after dispatching its target
      -Taskmaster: A resident of a town, or commander of an army, which improves
       work/combat by a large percentage, but also worsens morale.
      -Tormentor: A combat mage possessing of powerful spells.  Every spell it
       casts must be accompanied by live sacrifice.
      -Pitlord: A mighty, thunderous warrior which leaves corruption in its
       path and can singlehandedly dispatch a small army.  Pitlord are rare
       if gifted, and require a large amount of piety if summoned via prayer.
    Spread Corruption - Fallos will periodically spread corruption in and
      around your settlement.
  Wrath:
    Corrupt Blight - Fallos will corrupt terrain around your settlement.
    Demonic Plague - Fallos will send a plague against your town:
      -Foul Swarm: Locusts which destroy crops and create corruption.
      -Wave of Death: Citizens will die, selected at random.  The wave continues
        until a certain value is met; the value of the death follows the rules
        for sacrifice under Likes above.
      -Demonic Invasion: An army of demons strikes your town.  Occasionally, and
        only when Fallos is enraged with you, a Pitlord may strike.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Fallos offers the most power of any god, and is a strong choice for when
      an enemy must be destroyed quickly and with few resources.  However, the
      cost of worshipping Fallos is very high, exceeded only by the cost of
      angering Fallos.  Still, Fallos is a strong choice for those with an
      excess of sacrifice victims (large numbers of slaves, overpopulation).  If
      overpopulation is a concern, worshipping Fallos may be a better choice
      than simply letting people starve.

Artici - God of witchcraft and spells
  Likes:
    Wizards who worship her (they are counted (5x? 10x) for base piety)
  Dislikes:
  Quests:
    Ancient Tome - The location of an ancient magical tome is revealed to you.
      It must be retrieved within a time limit.  It may or may not contain
      valuable spells; the piety gain for completing this quest is higher for
      more useless books; better books are their own reward.
  Passive:
    The power of all your spells is increased slightly.
    Your magic schools contain one extra spell per level.
  Boons:
    Artici will occasionally offer your magic school a new spell.
  Wrath:
    Artici will dampen your magic abilities, reducing spell power or preventing
      casting entirely.
    Your magic schools, if they remain open, will be at high risk for magical
      explosion.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Artici is an easy-to-worship god for those interested in passive boosts to
      their magical abilities.  Artici is a good choice for those with very weak
      natural abilities who want to have some mastery of spells, or for more
      talented races who want a wider spell selection.

Usstang - God of insects, crawling things, hive minds, and poison
  Likes:
    When you use poison in combat.
  Dislikes:
    Declaring war on an insectoid race.
  Quests:
    Insectoid Visitation - A swarm of varied insects visits, allowing you to:
      -Give them free reign - Crops and forests are destroyed.  Usstang is
        highly pleased.
      -Divert them - Send the insects to another, nearby location.  Usstang is
        pleased if you send them to an area with crops or forest to devour, and
        displeased if you send them to empty areas.
      -Eat them - The insects are added to your food reservoir.  Usstang is
        highly displeased.
  Passive:
    Holy Poison - Your poisons are made more effective.  Insectoid races get a
      natural poison to their unarmed attack.
  Boons:
    Plague of Locusts - A swarm of locusts is sent to a selected location,
      destroying crops.
    Plague of Beetles - A swarm of beetles is sent to a selected location,
      destroying forests.
  Wrath:
    Plagues as above.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Worshipping Usstang is almost a non-option for races dependant on farms for
      food.  However, for those with alternate sources of food, it provides a
      powerful way to deny farming to neighbors, and a potent boost to combat.

Elderos - God of knowledge and divinations
  Likes:
    When you perform research.
    Active schools/universities (treated as a part of base piety).
  Dislikes:
    Lack of schools; at least one must be open or piety will drop.
  Quests:
    Divine Knowledge - Elderos will reveal a technology of limited or no
      practical application.  You must research it within a time limit.
    Divine Destiny - Elderos will create a special event which happens at a
      specific location.  You must send a priest to this location before the
      event occurs.  The event may be an attack, an appearance of a special
      monster, a chance meeting, etc.
  Passive:
    Quest for Knowledge - Elderos increases the output of your research
      facilities.
  Boons:
    Who - Delivers information on a hero.  Gives their location, skills, and
      recent history (missions completed, etc)
    What - Delivers information on a settlement.  May include production,
      population, heroes, etc.
    Where - Delivers information on a location.  Reveals the map, monsters, etc
    When - Predicts events for the future (storms, attacks, etc)
  Wrath:
    Ignorance - Elderos will decrease or stop the output of your research
      facilities.  This is only removed by actually performing research.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Elderos's boost to research is of interest to players interested in the tech
      aspect of the game.  His boons of knowledge allow for newer players to
      handle randomness more easily.

Nur Derel - God of necromancy and preying upon the weak
  Likes:
    Live sacrifice.  Deliberate sacrifices increase your Sacrifice Counter by 2
      (or more?).  Your Sacrifice Counter is capped at your piety level.
      Sacrifices are all worth the same amount, regardless of race, class, etc.
  Dislikes:
    Any healing.  Upon taking Nur Derel as your patron deity, a prompt will be
      given to close hospitals, if any exist.
  Quests:
    Reaping - Nur Derel will designate a nearby settlement.  It will always be
      weaker than your own; it may be a minor settlement (hunters, bandits, etc)
      or a city proper.  You are called upon to attack it within a time limit,
      and to kill all there.  All those killed increase your sacrifices by 1.5x
      the normal rate.
    Dark Ceremony - Nur Derel occasionally requires a soul to feed upon.  A
      portal is opened at some distance from your city (it will try to place
      itself in an area of Very High Magic; if that isn't doable, it will be at
      the maximum radius from your city).  You must bring a designated sacrifice
      to the portal; the sacrifice is chosen at random, and may be a slave,
      noble, or even a hero.  If the sacrifice is brought to the portal, it is
      immediately devoured and you gain a large piety boost; if the sacrifice
      dies before reaching the portal, or if the portal closes (long timeout),
      Nur Derel is angered.
  Passive:
    Raise Dead - Anyone killed in your city, or in the presence of a priest of
      Nur Derel, is immediately raised as a wight.  Wights are treated as slaves
      for all intents, but have no morale requirements, absolute loyalty, etc.
      They also function at slightly-reduceds skill levels.  Every individual
      raised reduces your Sacrifice Counter by 1, but does not affect your
      piety.
  Boons:
    Necrodivination - At high piety cost, a captured hero can be killed and
      ressurrected as a ghost, with their memories from their past life laid out
      for examination.  This essentially grants you an immediate and free spy
      mission, with a limited number of espionage points (how do we determine
      this number?) and perfect success.
  Wrath:
    Undead Rebellion - Any remaining undead in your city instantly turn on you,
      attacking those nearby.  If there are dead in your cemetaries, they will
      be raised and attack.
  Playstyle Notes:
    Nur Derel offers you a way to get rid of excessive slaves or peasants which
      you cannot afford to feed, and do not have a better use for.  Since Nur
      Derel does not value higher classes more, this encourages a more "top-
      heavy" society.  Since undead workers are nearly as good as peasants at
      manual labor, it's possible to do away with the peasantry altogether, if
      you have sufficient piety, and exist as a necromancer lord--allowing you
      to use draconian laws, extended warfare, or other options often prohibited
      by threat of rebellion.
    For all the game-changing power that Nur Derel offers, it's also a risky
      gambit; the number of undead followers you can sustain is limited by Nur
      Derel's favor, which can dip if you fail a quest, or if you do not make
      sacrifices quickly enough.
