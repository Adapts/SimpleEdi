De Re Militari - Publius Favius Vegetius Renatus

"The main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions for
 oneself and to destroy the enemy by famine. Famine is more terrible than the
 sword."

"It is better to beat the enemy through want, surprises, and care for difficult
 places (i.e., through manoeuvre) than by a battle in the open field"
