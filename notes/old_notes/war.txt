When an AI considers going to war, they weigh costs vs. benefits
All values are multiplied by a % of certainty
Obviously all these values need to be measured on the same scale
Key:
  >Specific value
  ?Potential adjustor
  %Percentage to multiply it by
  !Possible flaw in schema



Costs:
 %How likely is it that war is inevitable?
 %How ready are we now--versus how ready we will be next turn
 >Economic
   >Loss of trade with enemy
     ?Can this trade be replaced?  e.g. another source of resource X
   >Price of equipping an army
     %How much is recouped / will be useful to us after the war?
 >Goodwill
   >Loss of goodwill with enemy
   >Loss of goodwill with enemy's friends
   >Loss of general upstanding
     ?Do we care if we're viewed as warlike?
 >Lives
   >Lives of assault
     %How useful they are outside of combat
   >Lives in defense
     %How likely we are to be on the defense
 >Citizen morale
   >General dislike of war
     ?Are our citizens naturally anti-war?
     ?What is our citizens' opinion of the enemy?
     ?Do our social policies encourage/glorify war?
   >Morale loss due to fear
     %How likely is failure/fear?

Benefits:
 >Spoils of war
   ?What do they have that we can take?
     %How badly do we need it?  No sense attacking for iron if we're iron-rich
   ?Can we enslave them?
 >Status - do we want others to fear us
   >Enemy's fear
   >Enemy's friends' fear
   >General fear
   ?Are we likely to instill that fear?
     !Does this conflict with "chance of success?"
 >Citizen morale
   ?Does our culture glorify or vilify war?
   %How likely is success/celebration?
 >Pre-emptive strike
   ?Do they seem poised to attack?
   %What advantage does a pre-emptive strike gain us, as compared to letting
    them attack first?
   !Does this conflict with "inevitability of war" in Costs?
 >Social rule
   ?Do they have social policies that contradict ours?
     >Religion
     >Laws
       ?Do these laws directly affect us?  e.g. import laws
   ?Do we have social policies which we want to spread?
 >Territory
   ?Does their territory encrouch upon ours?
   %Value of their territory
