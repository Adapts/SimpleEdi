Trade:
-Free Trade: All civilians will buy whatever they want
-Domestic First: Foreign goods may not be purchased if domestic goods exist
  This promotes internal commerce, but limits availability of higher-quality
  foreign goods, and may discourage caravans from visiting you.
-Designated Port: Foreign caravans must offer all goods for sale
  This allows you to take advantage of caravans traveling through your city, but
  also discourages them from doing so.  As such, it's best used by cities
  located on an important trade route.

Liberties:

Military:
*Pacifist: Morale bonus equal to war weariness, but this is lost, and weariness
           is doubled, for wars you start
-None: No civilians will be available for military placement.
-Volunteer: Only volunteers will be available for placement.
  Volunteer rate is dependant on:
    -War weariness level; if high, few or none will volunteer.  If negative,
     many will volunteer
    -War status; if at war, volunteers increase.  If attacks are imminent,
     volunteers greatly increase
-Conscription: You may select citizens for military service at will.
  Morale drops as conscription increases.
  Loyalty drops as conscription increases, unless you have military success.
-Compulsory: A player-set percentage of adults are automatically added to your
             military.
  Morale penalty based on war weariness.
-Total: All adults are considered to be in military service, but may perform
        other jobs unless sent afield.
  Morale penalty based on war weariness, plus war status
