Magi:
When you build a mage tower (or whatever it's called), 1-3 mage flavors from the
following list become available as jobs for merchants, depending on your race's
magic skill.
Upgrading the mage tower (two upgrades?) unlocks another flavor.
You can send merchants away to other cities to train them in further flavors...
but that usually costs money (and is a dangerous/expensive voyage, etc).
Should some of these be advanced, and only available to burghers?  Maybe.
