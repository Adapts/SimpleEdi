At present, the government system is similar to communism; the government (i.e.
the player) owns all businesses/industry and any workers work for the
government, with the exception of "free citizens" who perform their own work and
thus produce taxes.

This is good simple gameplay but it'd be nice to have other options.

For instance, we could let citizens (merchants or burghers) own businesses (i.e.
areas or buildings).  This would mean:
  -They employ citizens - they pay the wages.  We can tax the wages.
  -They choose what the business produces.  Farms/mines choose their crops or
   minerals, and productive buildings choose their output.
  -They're responsible for buying any ingredients.  If they own a blacksmith,
   they must buy iron (import it, buy it from the government, or buy it from a
   privately-owned mine/forge).
  -They own the output.  It can then be sold to the citizens (generating taxes)
   or to the government (you must pay them) or exported (also taxable).
  -The area/building can't be closed without either buying it from them (if they
   are willing to sell!) or generating some serious discontentment.

This would be a complex feature, both from a development point of view and a
gameplay point of view.
Development challenges:
  -Choose when to create a new business and what business to start.  Maybe we
   always create a business when the class has enough money (and it's permitted
   by the government of course).  Do we randomly choose a business type?  Or try
   to determine what's needed?  A simple solution would be to weight the
   available options by the number that already exist; our city has 8 farms and
   2 mines, so we're more likely to choose a mine than a farm.
  -Choose what to produce.  We'll need some way of determining demand (not too
   hard I guess, just track how many buyers and how much each one wants) and a
   price (which we'll probably have to do anyway for intercity trade); then we
   just produce whatever has the highest demand/price.
  -Determine how much to produce?  Or should we always just hire as many workers
   as possible and output as much as possible?
  -Find a source for any materials we need to buy; this can probably share code
   with AI intercity trade.
  -Find a buyer for whatever we produce.  This can also probably share code with
   AI intercity trade.
  -Actually model cashflow.  All business need their own cash pool, and money
   must flow:

               +--<--Purchases--<--+
               v         v         ^
      +----------+       ~       +----------+
   +-<| Business |>-->-Wages->-->| Citizens |
   |  +----------+       v       +----------+
   v       ^    ^--+     ~
Imports~Exports>~~~~~~~~~>~~~~Taxes~~>~~
   v       ^       |                   v
   |  +----------+ ^             +------------+
   +->| Neighbor | +-Purchases--<| Government |
      |    or    |               +------------+
      |  Other   |
      | Business |
      +----------+

Design/Gameplay/Interface challenges:
  -Once the player has "activated" capitalism, how do they "authorize" the
   creation of private businesses?
    -We can assume that all of the land (within our radius of control) is owned
     by the city.  So maybe there's a pseudoarea we can place called "Lease
     Land."  Once this is placed, if the burgher class has enough money (per
     citizen?) they can put up a down payment and build a business.
      -Alternatively, we could outright sell the land for a much larger fee - 
       but once it's sold we have to buy it back (most likely for a larger
       amount).
    -For building-based businesses (forge, blacksmith, etc), we could have an
     area that's "free trade zone" - will only be filled with citizen-owned
     businesses.
      -Alternatively, there could be a building called "Empty Building" or
       similar that works like "Lease Land" above.
