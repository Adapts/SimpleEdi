Farming:
  We can farm for "food crops" or "special crops."  Each area only has a few
  crops available, so you'll need to trade to get most!

  Farms can support up to 10 workers.

  Food crops all produce <farm skill> food per day:
  SKILL     FOOD
      1     1.0
      2     2.0
      3     3.0
      4     4.0
      5     5.0

  This is also multipled by the terrain's farmability:

Special crops include:
  -Spices:  Morale commodity.
  -Drugs:   Morale commodity.  May be addictive (i.e. failure to meet demand has
            negative social effects)
  -Poisons: Used by nobility (heroes, assassins) and military units to turn
            wounding hits into killing hits.
  -Fibers:  Used for constructing cloth.
